# Social_Network_API

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project was to introduce users to learn about NoSQL databases to create a Progressive Web Application (or PWA). NoSQL databases allow one to easily store and retrieve unstructured data which can improve performance for applications that use a lot of data. In this challenge we used MongoDB to store data using documents in BSON format. Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper was also used to map MongoDB's document representations of data to a virtual database. This objecct-oriented approach is similar to the way that Object Relational Models (or ORM) work.

Finally, after setting up the NoSQL database routes were tested with Insomnia to make sure that the server was accepting and sending out information on the Social Network API application.

## Resources Used/ Dependencies

1. Mongoose
2. MongoDB
3. Express
4. Visual Studio
5. Google
6. Insomnia
7. Google Screencastify

## Commands to Launch the Application
Simply clone this code and install Mongoose with `install mongoose` and `install express`. Install MongoDB Community Edition on Windows or Mac. Run `mongod` in one termainl open another terminal then run `npm start` to connect to the server. Use Insomnia to test the routes for the Social Network API.
